# Convex Hull Algorithms Research and Shortest Path Algorithms Implementations

This repository contains code implementations and research findings related to two fundamental topics in computational geometry and graph theory: Convex Hull Algorithms and Shortest Path Algorithms.

## Convex Hull Algorithms: Jarvis' March and Graham's Scan

### Research Report
- The research report titled **JARVIS-GRAHAM.pdf** in the **Convex Hull** folder provides insights into the performance comparison of Jarvis' March algorithm and Graham's Scan algorithm. It includes analysis of runtime, operation count, and scalability under various scenarios.

### Code Implementation
- In the **Code** folder, you can find the implementation of Jarvis' March algorithm in **problem1a.c** and Graham's Scan algorithm in **problem1b.c**. These programs can be executed to evaluate the performance of each algorithm.

## Graphs and Shortest Path Implementation

### Description
- The **Description.docx** file in the **Graph and Shortest Path** folder offers a comprehensive overview of the graph data structure and shortest path algorithms implemented in this project.

### Code Implementation
- The implementation of various shortest path algorithms, including Dijkstra's algorithm and others, can be found in the **Code** folder. Files such as **problem2a.c**, **problem2b.c**, **problem2c.c**, **problem2d.c**, and **utils.c** showcase the practical implementation of these algorithms.
